- mining of blocks is not different from sending tokens
- mining of the block is synchonious with creation of the transaction
- and when a user send a token to another user he imediately mines it

- each input of the transaction will store a public key which is not hashed and than a signature of the entire transaction

-IDEA: the hash of the public key inside od the input will have to mach up with the referenced output

- output has the hash of the public key directly inside of it, input public key not hashed
- hashing method that is hashing the input public key and checking weather they are matching
